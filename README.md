# Facebook Display

I made this program originally for a project in school where we had to make a fake "facebook" page. The existing online tools for doing so were too clunky for my own preference and did not allow simultaneous edits. Facebook Display aimed to fix this by allowing me to customize it easily and so that my groupmates could edit a shared doc which then easily transfers data to show on here.

## Usage

To build, use `npm run build`. Then open `index.html` in a web browser -- Chrome works best for printing the document to pdf.

Drag and drop or Browse to select the `data.json` file generated by the Docs extension.
